# Results

The output of fDOG runs including the *.extended.fa*, *_forward.domains*, *_reverse.domains* and *phyloprofile* files. 

For each file there is another version (*.gh*) in which the seed protein IDs were mapped to their enzyme families. These *.gh* files were generated using the scripts in `scripts` folder. 

The phylogenetic profile output excluding the invalid taxa (see `data/invalid_taxids.txt`) is saved in *phyloprofile.gh.valid* or *phyloprofile.valid* file.

TIP: the merged outputs were created using `fdog.mergeOutput` function :)
